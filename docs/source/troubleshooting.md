Build failures
==============

Check the following if the project fails to build or generate a bitstream:

1. | **Are you using the correct version of Vivado for this version of the repository?**
   | Check the version specified in the Requirements section of the README.md file.

2. | **Did you copy/clone the repo into a short directory structure?**
   | Vivado on Windows doesn't cope well with long directory structures, so copy/clone the repo into a short directory structure such as
     ``C:\projects\``. When working in long directory structures, you can get errors relating to missing files, particularly files 
     that are normally generated by Vivado (FIFOs, etc).

3. | **Did you follow the** `Build instructions <build_instructions.html>`_ **?**
   | If it still doesn't build, please let us know and provide details of your setup and the error message(s).
